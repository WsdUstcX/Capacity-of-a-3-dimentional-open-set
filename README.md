# Capacity-of-a-3-dimentional-open-set
This mini project gives a theoretic justification and some simulations of the definition of the capacity of a 3-dimentional open set, which is the mathematical interpretation of the capacitance of a conductor. 
It is done during the course "Variational analysis of partial differential equations".
